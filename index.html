        My name is Josh Segel, I am a 25 year old from Chicago, IL, currently studying to become a web developer. Before deciding to pursue a career as a web developer I worked as a freight broker for Echo Global Logistics for 3.5 years. 
            <br>
            <br>
        I would like to return to the transportation/logistics industry at the completion of this class and when my non-compete runs out due to the veritable tech "arms race" currently going on within the sector and apply my existing industry knowledge to helping develop new tools for industry professionals.
            <br>
            <br>
        Until then, I will be taking this class, feel free to take a look around and see some made up projects of mine.
