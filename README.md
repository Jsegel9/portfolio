# Josh Segel Portfolio
## Description
I have created this Portfolio website as a place to showcase the various projects that I will create over my career as a developer. As I am only a week into said career at the time of writing this, the only real project I have to show for it is the portfolio itself. However as my career progresses this page will be updated to reflect an array of completed projects to showcase my skill as a developer.  
Through the creation of this webpage I have picked up several new skills including laying text over images, linking HTML pages to other HTML pages on my system and correctly linking to images saved on my local computer and writing a README file. In addition to that, I have greatly sharpened existing skills, properly laying out pages with CSS, clearing floats and creating common CSS style for multiple different cases of the same element.
